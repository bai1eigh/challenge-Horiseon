# Code Refactor Starter Code
This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

 In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

A few changes were made to the index.html as well as the style sheet. Some of these changes would include but are not limited to

1. comments on both the html and style sheet. Comments were placed on what is thought to be each section. 

2. Comments on style or html changes 

3. Telling the main body and navbar to stack vertically in a column

4. Consolidation of classes (unsure as if it is correct, but I do believe how it was before I reorganized it was correct)
